                        <p>Yes, gym time slots can be cancelled up to 2 hours before their start time. If you don't
                            cancel your gym time slots, and miss 3 or more within a 30 day period, a booking block will
                            be placed on your account for 3 days.</p>

                        <h3>Do I need to book a slot for the gym? (COVID-19 Related)</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Gym slots of 75 minutes must be booked on our class timetable. There will be a 15-minute
                            turn over time in between gym time slots in order to give everyone enough time to leave the
                            club and for the team to clean and sanitise the equipment ready for the next time slot.
                            Slots can be booked up to 3 days before at 9pm. For example, to book a slot on Monday the
                            20th of July, you can book from 9pm on Friday the 17th of July. This booking system will be
                            strictly enforced and if you have not booked a slot for the specific time you wish to come
                            to the gym, you will not be granted access to the gym.</p>

                            Related)</h3>
                        <p>our member's health and safety is our number one priority. We have introduced numerous new
                            safety precautions. These include every staff member and instructor having their temperature
                            checked and recorded in our staff safety log before their shift, and staff will be required
                            to wear masks and gloves during their shift. We have also installed multiple hand sanitising
                            stations around the club, including 2 motion-activated hand sanatisers which are located as
                            soon as you enter the gym. We have also invested in an electrostatic disinfectant
                            distributor. The new disinfectant allows us to spray more evenly, gets hard-to-reach
                            crevices, clings to every surface it coats, and is proven to kill viruses like COVID-19.
                            Staff will use this on surfaces in all common areas every day, with special attention to
                            bikes, weights, machines, and all high-touch surfaces each day. </p>

                        <p>Yes, but it will depend on your condition and medical clearance may need to be provided by
                            your doctor. We have specialised staff that can help you and members are regularly referred
                            to us by their doctor. If you have a specific medical issue, please email the details in
