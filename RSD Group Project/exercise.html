                    <strong>BASIC ENDURANCE</strong>
                    Intensity: around your aerobic threshold (heart rate of 60-70 percent of maximum –
                    you can comfortably converse with your companion).
                    Workout 30 minutes, interval N/A (constant pace, no intervals)
                    Between intervals, take a break: - (constant pace, no rest)
                    Benefits: The most common kind of endurance training is basic endurance, which consists
                    of low-intensity, high-volume workouts.
                    This degree of training improves your cardiac output and heart muscle strength, while
                    also boosting your immune system and lowering cholesterol and blood pressure.
                    Because the majority of the energy produced at this intensity originates from your
                    body fat, your metabolism will run more efficiently.

                <p id="eType2" class="black">
                    <strong>TEMPO ENDURANCE</strong>
                    Intensity: slightly below anaerobic threshold (heart rate approximately 75-85 percent
                    of maximum – only sentence-by-sentence communication is allowed).
                    Interval 10-30 minutes in duration (total length of work intervals does usually not exceed
                    45-60 min)
                    There is no standard guideline for resting between intervals, but keep the tempo easy.
                    The goal of this sort of endurance training is to increase your workload or speed at the
                    anaerobic threshold. Carbohydrates (sugar) provide the majority of the energy for this
                    activity, although
                    body fats also have a significant role.

                <p id="eType3" class="black">
                    <strong>MAXIMAL ENDURANCE</strong>
                    Intensity: approximately VO2max (heart rate around 90-95 percent of maximum – only
                    word-by-word
                    communication is feasible). Lactate builds up quickly during intervals, making your muscles
                    tight.
                    Interval 3-5 minutes in duration (total length of the work intervals should not exceed 15-20
                    minutes)
                    3-6 minutes of rest between intervals
                    Benefits: Maximal aerobic power is another term for maximum endurance. It's the case.
                    the most effective method for achieving maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max). The most of the
                    energy
                    Carbohydrates (sugar) account for the majority of your energy, with body fat accounting for
                    only a small portion.
